# Algorithms

Classification of algorithms by execution time.

Asymptotic complexity: estimating the execution time of an algorithm when the size of the input data approaches infinity. Typically written using "O-notation".

Classification of algorithms by execution time:

| Time complexity | Algorithm |
| --- | --- |
| O(1) | Constant Time |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic Time |
| O(n) | Linear Time |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic Time |
| O(n^2) | Quadratic Time |
| O(2^n) | Exponential Time |

### Setup

```shell
git clone git@github.com:amberlex78/algorithms.git && cd algorithms
composer insatll
```

### Run server

```shell
php -S localhost:8000
```

Chart.js is used to create charts.

### Implemented:

O(2^n) - Exponential Time
